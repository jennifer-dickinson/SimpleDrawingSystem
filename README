2. Instructions to make and run:
	
	make
	./draw 3d <file>

	While in the program, type help for commands
  
  A sample file "samplePolyhedron" is included. The format for a file is the following:

	<number of polyhedrons>

	<number of vertices>
	<vertex 1>
	<vertex 2>
	...

	<number of lines>
	<vertex a1> <vertex a2>
	<vertex b1> <vertex b2>
	...


3. Attempted algorithms:

	CohenSutherland: clipping.cp,p lines: 43-94
	Bresenham: bresenham.cpp, lines: all
	DDA: DigitalDifferentialAnalyzer, lines: all
	translation: polygon.cpp, lines: 115-124
	rotate: polygon.cpp, lines: 126-152
	scale: polygon.cpp, lines 95-113

4. Part's I didn't implement:

	1. Changing the viewbox
	2. Rasterizing

5. Attempts at extra credit: none

6. Other information:

	Clipping does not work when a worldPoint overlaps with two outside regions (bottom and left for example).
