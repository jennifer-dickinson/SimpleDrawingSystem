2. Instructions to make and run:
	
	make
	./draw 3d <file>

	While in the program, type help for commands
  
  A sample file "samplePolyhedron" is included. The format for a file is the following:

	<number of polyhedrons>

	<number of vertices>
	<vertex 1>
	<vertex 2>
	...

	<number of lines>
	<vertex a1> <vertex a2>
	<vertex b1> <vertex b2>
	...
