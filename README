2. Instructions to make and run:

		make
		./draw
		<Render Type> (3DS for project 3);
		<filename> (ShadedPolyhedron provided)


	While in the program, type help for commands

  A sample file "spoly" is included. The format for a file is the following:

			  3               # of polyhedrons

			  4               # of vertices
			  3 3 3 1 1 1     # X Y Z R G B
			  11 0 8 0 0 1
			  8 11 0 0 1 0
			  0 8 11 1 0 0
			  4               # number of triangles
			  0 1 2           # V1 V2 V3
			  0 3 1
			  0 2 3
			  1 3 2

3. Attempted algorithms:

    1. Painter's algorithm (shadedPolyhedron:lines 161-197, 260-307)
	2. Gouraud Shading (Draw.cpp: lines 162-177, 220-234)

4. Part's I didn't implement:
