2. Instructions to make and run:
	
	make
	./draw [filename (optional)]

	While in the program, type help for commands
  
  A sample file "bresenham" is included. The format for a file is the following:

	#polygons

	#vertices
	#vertex 1
	#vertex 2
	...

  Please note that the white space is important.

3. Attempted algorithms:

	CohenSutherland: clipping.cp,p lines: 43-94
	Bresenham: bresenham.cpp, lines: all
	DDA: DigitalDifferentialAnalyzer, lines: all
	translation: polygon.cpp, lines: 115-124
	rotate: polygon.cpp, lines: 126-152
	scale: polygon.cpp, lines 95-113

4. Part's I didn't implement:

	1. Changing the viewbox
	2. Rasterizing

5. Attempts at extra credit: none

6. Other information:

	Clipping does not work when a point overlaps with two outside regions (bottom and left for example).
